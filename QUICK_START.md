## 📊 Understanding the Interface

### Color Coding

**Task Priority:**
- 🟢 Green = Low Priority
- 🔵 Cyan = Medium Priority  
- 🟠 Orange = High Priority
- 🔴 Magenta = Critical Priority

**Server Health:**
- 🟢 Green dot = Healthy (< 70% load)
- 🟠 Orange dot = Warning (70-90% load)
- 🔴 Red dot (blinking) = Danger (> 90% load)

**Log Messages:**
- Gray = Information
- Green = Success
- Orange = Warning
- Red = Error

### Main Sections

**Top Bar:**
- System status and live clock
- Resource monitors
- Speed control
- Auto demo

**Left Panel:**
- Create tasks manually
- Generate tasks in bulk
- View task queue

**Center Panel:**
- Server cluster view
- Resource monitoring
- Control buttons

**Right Panel:**
- Completed tasks
- System logs
- Alerts

**Bottom Panel:**
- Performance charts
- KPI counters

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Getting the Best Results

**For Presentations:**
1. Use Auto Demo for quick showcase
2. Set speed to 2-3x for dynamic effect
3. Highlight specific features as they happen
4. Use fullscreen mode (F11)

**For Learning:**
1. Start with Education tab
2. Set simulation speed to 0.5x
3. Watch step-by-step explanations
4. Pause simulation to analyze

**For Research:**
1. Create controlled task sets
2. Run same scenario with different algorithms
3. Export analytics data (manual screenshots for now)
4. Compare performance metrics

### Common Questions

**Q: Tasks aren't being scheduled?**
A: Make sure simulation is running (click Start) and servers aren't overloaded.

**Q: How do I clear everything?**
A: Click the "⟲ Reset" button to start fresh.

**Q: Can I save my scenarios?**
A: Currently manual - future update will add save/load feature.

**Q: Charts not updating?**
A: Ensure simulation is running and tasks are completing.
